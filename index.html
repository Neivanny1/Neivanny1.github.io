          <p>
            As a music enthusiast with an eclectic taste, I felt frustrated 
            by the limitations of existing streaming platforms.

          <p class="blue">
            Their recommendations were predictable, often suggesting mainstream hits or 
            artists similar to ones they already knew. 
            I craved musical adventures, a chance to discover hidden gems from across genres and 
            time periods.
            Fueled by this desire, I ventured into the world of data science and music analysis.
            After months of experimentation, I created a recommendation 
            system that went beyond simple popularity metrics.
            The result? A personalized playlist experience that felt 
            like having a musical soulmate curate their listening journey.
